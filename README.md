## 📌 Project Overview

I trained a simple image classification model using **Google’s Teachable Machine**.  
The model includes **2–3 classes**, collected using webcam samples for each category.

This repository contains:

- **`tm-my-image-model.zip`** – exported Teachable Machine model  
- **Screen recording** of training and testing  
- **README documentation**

The model is capable of:

- Identifying the custom object classes used during training  
- Making real-time predictions using the webcam  
- Running directly inside a browser using the Teachable Machine interface
